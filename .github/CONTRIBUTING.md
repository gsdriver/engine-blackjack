## How to contribute

First of all thanks to taking the time to contribute, I highly appreciate any contribution you want to make.
This is a small project but each line is done in the hope that it will be useful for you, me and maybe them.

## Did you find a bug? (for everyone)

 * Check our [issue list](https://github.com/kedoska/engine-blackjack/issues) to be sure that it was not already reported.
 * [Open a new issue](https://github.com/kedoska/engine-blackjack/issues/new) if nobody is looking at the bug you found.

## Do you want this library to do something specific (for you)

 * So we did not included something that you use/want
 * Any new feature is welcome but please provide a nice step-by-step in the new issue
 * We will discuss the issue to convert it into small requirements.
 * If all the new requirements are acceptable, the functionality will be implemented
 * ... and available to everyone 

## Cosmetic code changes (for devs)

I'll probably reject PR having only cosmetic code changes. The main reason is that 
I'm currently using [standard-format](http://standardjs.com/) and most of the time 
it cares about those kind of issues.

## Have you/Do you want to fix a bug? (for everyone or devs)

Well, what can I say here, I really appreciate 

 1. Fork it!
 2. Create your featured branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
 3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'add some feature'`
 4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-feature`
 5. Submit a pull request

Many Thanks! :heart:
